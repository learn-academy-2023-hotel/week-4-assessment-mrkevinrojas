# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: The Document Object Model is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.

Researched answer: The DOM provides a way to access, manipulate and update the content and structure of web pages dynamically.  It is a programming interface for web documents.  It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document in a tree-like structure, where each element in the document is represented as an object.  

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: There is no need for a return keyword.

Researched answer: Methods in Ruby have an implicit return, which means that they automatically reutrn the value of the last evaluated expression within the method without explicitly using the 'return' keyword.  

3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: To define a function, Ruby uses 'def' and Javascript uses 'const'.  To close out conditional statements, loops and functions, Ruby uses 'end', whereas Javasripts requires you to use opening/closing => {}.  In a function, Ruby 'returns' the result implicitly, whereas you have to use the keyword 'return' to return the result.  

Researched answer: JavaScript and Ruby are high-level languages, which means they are designed to be relatively easy for humans to read and write. Both languages are dynamically typed which means you don't need to specify the data type of a variable.   They both automatically manage memory by deallocatin g objects that are no longer in use.  

Differences are:  Javascript is used for client-web development and Ruby is used for server-side web development.  Javascript runs in a web browser and Ruby runs on the server-side.  Javascript uses C-style syntax and Ruby has a more natural and human friendly syntax.  

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: The version control system that helps manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all code modifications.

Researched answer: It is a tool that allows developers to manage and switch between different versions of programming languages, libraries, or frameworks on thier development environment.  

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: A behaviour-driven development framework for Ruby that is used for writing and executing tests for Ruby Applications.  It also provides a domain specific language for writing human-readable and expressive specifications or tests.  Widely used in the Ruby community for writing tests that not only ensure the correctness of code but also serve as documentation for the expected behavior of the application.

2. Test-driven development: A software development methodology in which developers write tests for their code before writing the code itself.  It involves three steps often referred as the "red-green-refactor" cycle.  

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  It represents the four basic operations for managing data in a database of data storage system.  The are associated with web applications and database systems and correspond to the basic actions users can perform when interacting with these applications.
